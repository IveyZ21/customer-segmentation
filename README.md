# customer-segmentation

## Project Overview

It’s crucial for any business to classify the customers as of different segments by specific characteristics. By understanding the behavior and the consumption logics of each segment, a company can target the right consumer groups and make effective advertisement campaign.

In this project, we will use machine learning techniques to analyze demographics data of customers of a mail-order company in Germany. The goal of this project is to create customers segments of population, and to build a model to predict weather a customer will respond to future campaign.


## Problem Statement

The main business questions for this project can be divided as follows:
•	What are the segments of the general German population and customer population?
We will implement unsupervised machine learning models to perform classification for the customers and the general population.
•	How are these segments related to the Arvato customers database?
By comparing the customer population to the general population, we could identify features that best describe the customers.
•	What are the predictions of the targeted customers to the mail advertising campaign?
A prediction model will then be created to identify individuals who are more likely to respond to the campaign.


## Libraries

The code is written in python 3. Libraries used include numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and sklearn.
